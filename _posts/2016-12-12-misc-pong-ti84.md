# TI-84 Pong Game Tutorial

In this tutorial, I'll guide you through the process of creating a simple Pong game for the TI-84 calculator using TI-BASIC. Pong is a classic arcade game that involves two paddles and a ball. The objective is to bounce the ball back and forth between the paddles, scoring points when the opponent misses the ball.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a TI-84 calculator and the cable to connect it to your computer. You'll also need TI Connect CE software to transfer programs to the calculator.

## Getting Started

1. **Open the Program Editor:**
   - Turn on your TI-84 calculator.
   - Press `PRGM` to open the Program menu.
   - Select `NEW` to create a new program. Name it "PONG."

2. **Setting Up the Game Variables:**
   - Add the following variables to the program:
     ```ti-basic
     :ClrHome
     :AxesOff
     :GridOff
     :CoordOff
     :94→Xmax
     :62→Ymax
     :0→X
     :0→Y
     :1→A
     :randInt(-5,5)→B
     ```

## Main Game Loop

3. **Creating the Main Game Loop:**
   - Use a `While` loop to create the main game loop:
     ```ti-basic
     :While 1
     :getKey→K
     :Output(Y,X,"O")
     :Pause 20
     :Output(Y,X," ")
     :Y+B→Y
     :X+A→X
     :End
     ```

## Paddle Movement

4. **Implementing Paddle Movement:**
   - Use the arrow keys to control the paddle movement:
     ```ti-basic
     :If K=25 and Y>1
     :Then
     :Y-1→Y
     :End
     :If K=34 and Y<60
     :Then
     :Y+1→Y
     :End
     ```

## Ball Collision

5. **Handling Ball Collision:**
   - Implement logic for ball bouncing off walls and paddles:
     ```ti-basic
     :If X=0 or X=93
     :Then
     :A*(-1)→A
     :End
     :If Y=1 or Y=61
     :Then
     :B*(-1)→B
     :End
     ```

## Scoring

6. **Adding Scoring Mechanism:**
   - Keep track of the score and display it on the screen:
     ```ti-basic
     :If X=93
     :Then
     :0→X
     :0→Y
     :1→A
     :randInt(-5,5)→B
     :End
     ```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created a basic Pong game for the TI-84 calculator. Feel free to customize and enhance the game with additional features, such as sound effects or advanced gameplay mechanics.
